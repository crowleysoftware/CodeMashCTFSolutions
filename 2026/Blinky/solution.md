The animated GIF encodes the flag in the blinking pattern of the light. The encoding is morse code, where a short blink represents a dot (.) and a long blink represents a dash (-). By analyzing the blinking pattern frame by frame, you can decode the morse code to reveal the flag.

To decode you can:
- Just read it if you are familiar with morse code.
- Upload the file to ChatGPT and ask it to decode the morse code for you.
- Open the GIF in an image editor and analyze the frames to extract the blinking pattern, then decode the morse code manually or with a morse code translator tool. Gimp is a good free tool for this.
